# 🌍 REST Countries Explorer — Frontend Mentor Challenge

This project is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) on Frontend Mentor. It’s a fully responsive and accessible React application that allows users to explore detailed information about countries around the world, with support for light/dark themes and custom navigation logic.

## 📌 Overview

This web application is built with **React** and **SASS**, consuming the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to display comprehensive data about countries. One of the unique aspects of this project is the **manual implementation of routing**, which helped me deepen my understanding of client-side navigation without relying on external libraries.

Users can search for countries, filter by region, view detailed country pages, navigate through bordering nations, and toggle between light and dark modes — all within a clean and responsive UI.

### 🎯 The Challenge

Users can:

* ✅ View all countries from the API on the homepage
* 🔍 Search for a country using an input field
* 🌍 Filter countries by region
* 📄 Click on a country to see detailed information
* 🔁 Navigate through border countries from the detail page
* 🌗 Toggle between light and dark color themes

## 🛠 My Process

### ⚙️ Built With

* Semantic **HTML5**
* **SASS** and CSS custom properties
* **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid**
* **Mobile-first** responsive design
* [React](https://react.dev/) (including Hooks)
* **Manual routing** without `react-router-dom`

### 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me refine several technical skills and broaden my problem-solving abilities:

* 🧠 **Custom Hooks** – Reused logic efficiently and kept components clean.
* 🧭 **Manual Routing** – Built a simple yet effective routing system from scratch to control page navigation without external dependencies.
* 🌐 **API Integration** – Fetched and rendered dynamic data from the REST Countries API.
* 🔄 **State Management** – Handled global state with `useContext` to share data across components like the theme toggle.
* 📱 **Responsive Design** – Ensured accessibility and usability across different screen sizes.
* ⚛️ **React Ecosystem** – Took advantage of core React features like the virtual DOM, conditional rendering, and component lifecycles.
